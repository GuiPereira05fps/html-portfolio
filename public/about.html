            <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Guilhermy, I live in Regi√£o dos Lagos - RJ-BR and I'm in love with IT.</p>
            <p>I always had this passion about technology and everything it leads to. Specially, when it comes to software development and functioning.</p>

            <p>Right after graduating from High School, I started to take IT study seriously. That's why, in this moment, I'm part of a Google's and JA Brasil's IT Support program, called TechJA, which includes five courses and six certificates in its total. In my daily classes, I've been learning about Hardware, Software, Windows, Linux, Computing Network, Cloud, Troubleshooting, System Management, Information Security, Virtual Machines and a lot more. Furthermore, the program also has Soft Skills classes, where themes such as Communication, Teamwork, Values, Personal and Professional growth and others more are approached.</p>

            <p>My next step will be becoming a Software Developer. What else will future introduce me to?</p>
